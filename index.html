Author Carpentry is a researcher-to-researcher training and outreach
program in open authoring and publishing, scholarly identity and
reputation, and research impact. Inspired by the <a
href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/modern-scientific-authoring/">Modern
Scientific Authoring</a> lesson proposed by Software Carpentry founder
Greg Wilson, Author Carpentry was envisioned by founder Gail
Peretsman-Clement to complement and extend the research pipelines
covered in Software and Data Carpentry. Author Carpentry picks up the
“last mile” of the research process: writing, reporting, review,
dissemination and licensing, impact measurement, and establishing author
identity and reputation (as shown in the illustration above).
