# Online Introduction to LaTeX

## Background
LaTeX is free software under the terms of the [LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL)](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/). LaTeX is distributed through [CTAN servers](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#ctan) or comes as part of many easily installable and usable [TeX distributions provided by the TeX User Group (TUG)](http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free) or third parties. More information is available from the [LaTeX project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). 

## Setup Requirements
### Online - Overleaf
This lesson will be taught using Overleaf. If you want to follow along using the same program, create a free account and log in to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and access the projects linked in the [lesson slides](https://jdlm.info/latex-course/en/part1.pdf). Here is the link to the first [example document](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?snip_uri=https://raw.github.com/jdleesmiller/latex-course/master/en/basics.tex&splash=none).

### Desktop 
You can install a full TeX distribution on your local machine and still follow along with the lesson. Information on how to choose and install a distribution is available from the [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions) or you can contact the [instructor](mailto:kathryn.miller@nist.gov) for assistance.
