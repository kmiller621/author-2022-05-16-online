# Online introduction to LaTeX

## Setup Requirements
### Online - Overleaf
This lesson will be taught using Overleaf. If you want to follow along using the same program, log in to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) and access the  projects linked in the [lesson slides](https://jdlm.info/latex-course/en/part1.pdf). Here is the link to the first [example document](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?snip_uri=https://raw.github.com/jdleesmiller/latex-course/master/en/basics.tex&splash=none).

### Desktop 
You can use your own TeX authoring program and still follow along with the lesson. If you are new to LaTeX and would rather use a desktop application, TeXstudio is a good alternative to Overleaf. Information on how to install and configure TeXStudio is [available online](https://www.texstudio.org/#download), or you can contact the [instruction](mailto:kathryn.miller@nist.gov) for assistance.
