## General Information
<img src="img/AC_Pipeline.png" alt="Author Carpentry Pipeline" width="666" height="444" border="1">
Author Carpentry is a researcher-to-researcher training and outreach program in
open authoring and publishing, scholarly identity and reputation, and research
impact. Inspired by the [Modern Scientific
Authoring](https://swcarpentry.github.io/modern-scientific-authoring/) lesson
proposed by Software Carpentry founder Greg Wilson, Author Carpentry was
envisioned by founder Gail Peretsman-Clement to complement and extend the 
research pipelines covered in Software and Data Carpentry. Author Carpentry 
picks up the "last mile" of the research process: writing, reporting, review, 
dissemination and licensing, impact measurement, and establishing author identity and reputation (as shown in the illustration below).  

**Who:**  The course is for people responsible for authoring or publishing scholarly content. **You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.**

**Where:**  This training will take place online.  [Please register in advance](https://forms.gle/UcRHrtVfCUUgypJe9). The instructors will provide you with the information you will need to connect to this meeting.

**When:**  May 16-17, 2022.

  "description": "Author Carpentry, is a researcher- to -researcher training
and outreach program to enhance scientific authorship and publishing in the
digital age. The aim of Author Carpentry is to promote and support good
information handling tools, practices, and skills that help researchers
prepare, submit, and publish contributions that add value to the scholarly
record and invite others to adapt and build upon them. AuthorCarpentry promotes
the Force11 FAIR principles ensuring that scientific outputs are Findable,
Accessibe, Interoperable, and Reuseable. FAIR puts specific emphasis on
enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in
addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.",
