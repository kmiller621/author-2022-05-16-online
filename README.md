## General Information
<img src="img/AC_Pipeline.png" alt="Author Carpentry Pipeline" width="666" height="444" border="1">  

Author Carpentry is a researcher-to-researcher training and outreach program in
open authoring and publishing, scholarly identity and reputation, and research
impact. Inspired by the [Modern Scientific
Authoring](https://swcarpentry.github.io/modern-scientific-authoring/) lesson
proposed by Software Carpentry founder Greg Wilson, Author Carpentry was
envisioned by founder Gail Peretsman-Clement to complement and extend the 
research pipelines covered in Software and Data Carpentry. Author Carpentry 
picks up the "last mile" of the research process: writing, reporting, review, 
dissemination and licensing, impact measurement, and establishing author identity and reputation (as shown in the illustration above).

**Who:**  The course is for people responsible for authoring or publishing scholarly content. **You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.**

**Where:**  This training will take place online.  [Please register in advance](https://forms.gle/UcRHrtVfCUUgypJe9). The instructors will provide you with the information you will need to connect to this meeting.

**When:**  May 16-17, 2022.  [Add to your Google Calendar.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Author%20Carpentry%20Workshop&dates=20220516/20220517&trp=false&sprop&sprop=name:&sf=true&output=xml&location=online&details=Author%20Carpentry%20Workshop%20at%20National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology%20(NIST))

**Requirements:**  Participants must have access to a computer with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have the data and software packages installed for each lesson ([DOI](https://kmiller621.github.io/dois-citation-data/#requirements), [ORCID](https://kmiller621.github.io/orcid-profile/#requirements), [LaTeX](latex.html)).

**Accessibility:**  We are dedicated to providing a positive and accessible learning environment for all. Please notify the instructors in advance of the workshop if you require any accommodations or if there is anything we can do to make this workshop more accessible to you.

**Set up Your Workspace:** Like other Carpentries workshops, you will be learning by "coding along" with the Instructors. To do this, you will need to have both the window for the tool you will be learning about (a terminal, RStudio, your web browser, etc..) and the window for the Zoom video conference client open. In order to see both at once, we recommend using one of the following set up options:

- Two monitors: If you have two monitors, plan to have the tool you are learning up on one monitor and the video conferencing software on the other.
- Two devices: If you don't have two monitors, do you have another device (tablet, smartphone) with a medium to large sized screen? If so, try using the smaller device as your video conference connection and your larger device (laptop or desktop) to follow along with the tool you will be learning about.
- Divide your screen: If you only have one device and one screen, practice having two windows (the video conference program and one of the tools you will be using at the workshop) open together. How can you best fit both on your screen? Will it work better for you to toggle between them using a keyboard shortcut? Try it out in advance to decide what will work best for you.
- This [blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/06/online-workshop-logistics-and_screen-layouts/) includes detailed information on how to set up your screen to follow along during the workshop.
